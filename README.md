#### In order to proper working jQuery 3.6 and Bootstrap 5 is required!  
(I'm new to git and github, and I honestly have no idea that should I add bootstrap and jQuery to git)

So I'm learning JS and I decided to make a markdown editor based on JS.

Currently I'm working on basic functionality, and at this moment emdeet is supporting:
- Headers tag - `<h1>...<h6>`
- Unordered list (single list for whole document) `<ul><li>`
- Header tag in list
- Paragraph tag `<p>`
