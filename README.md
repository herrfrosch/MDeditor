# emdeet

*Emdeet* is an online *markdown* editor which supports basic syntax of *markdown* format.

It's my first serious programming project, which I've been doing for few months. At current stage of development I'm debugging markdown parser, and working on more responsive site. Also I want to implement export function, in order to getting `.html` and `.md` files and browser-saved files library.

**In order to proper use, you need to add Bootstrap 5 and jQuery 3.6.1**. (I'll set *emdeet's* website soon.)
