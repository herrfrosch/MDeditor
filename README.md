# emdeet

*Emdeet* is an online *markdown* editor which supports basic syntax of *markdown* format.

In order to parsing *markdown* syntax I wrote parser in vanilla JS, whole parser can be found in the `scripts/main.js`, also I implemented downloading and uploading markdown (`.md`) files serverless through File API. With help of localStorage I implented saving notes in the browser, which can be helpful if you want to reopen your notes or store them only at the website. 

Current version: 1.0

I'll implement more features to the *emdeet* in the future, but at this moment I want to foucs on another projects.
